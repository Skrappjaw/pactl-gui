# PulseAudio Control GUI (pactl-gui)

A lightweight graphical user interface for managing PulseAudio modules and configurations.

## Project Overview

PulseAudio Control GUI provides a simple, user-friendly interface for common PulseAudio tasks that would otherwise require command-line expertise. The application focuses on managing audio modules, creating virtual devices, and setting up audio routing configurations for specific use cases.

## Current Features (MVP)

- **Sink/Source Management**: View all PulseAudio sinks and sources with details
- **Duplex Sink Creation**: Create duplex sinks with custom names and channel configurations
- **Module Management**: View and unload PulseAudio modules
- **Basic Preset Saving**: Save current configuration as a preset
- **Command Output Display**: View the results of PulseAudio operations

## Future Features

- **Preset Loading**: Load saved configurations
- **Terminal Integration**: Execute custom PulseAudio commands with real-time feedback
- **Advanced Configuration Options**: More detailed module configurations
- **Visual Audio Routing**: Visualize and modify audio connections

## Target Users

- Linux gaming enthusiasts who need special audio configurations
- Content creators who require complex audio routing
- Audio professionals working with virtual devices
- Regular users who find PulseAudio CLI commands intimidating

## Design Philosophy

The application adheres to the following principles:

1. **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and system resource usage
2. **User-Friendly**: Simple interface that abstracts complex commands
3. **Powerful**: Provide access to full PulseAudio functionality
4. **Educational**: Help users understand PulseAudio concepts

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Python with Tkinter (minimal dependencies)
- **Backend**: Direct interaction with PulseAudio via `pactl` commands

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- PulseAudio with pactl command
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI package)

### Installing Dependencies

#### PulseAudio
Check if pactl is installed:
```bash
which pactl
```
If not installed, install it with your package manager:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-utils

# Fedora
sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install pulseaudio-utils
```

#### Tkinter
Tkinter is usually included with Python, but if not installed:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install python313-tk  # Replace 313 with your Python version

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S tk
```

### Installation

There are two ways to install PulseAudio Control GUI:

#### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skrappjaw/pactl-gui.git
cd pactl-gui
```

2. Run the installation script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Check for all required dependencies
- Install the application to your user directory (`~/.local/share/pactl-gui`)
- Create a command-line launcher (`pactl-gui` command)
- Add a desktop entry for your application menu
- Provide helpful feedback and error messages

3. Launch the application:
- From your application menu: **Audio â†’ PulseAudio GUI**
- From terminal: `pactl-gui`

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer to run directly from the source directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Skrappjaw/pactl-gui.git
cd pactl-gui

# Run the application directly
python3 src/main.py
```

#### Uninstallation

To remove the application completely:
```bash
# If installed with install.sh:
~/.local/share/pactl-gui/uninstall.sh

# Or use the uninstall script from the source directory:
./uninstall.sh
```

### Usage

The application is organized into tabs:

1. **Create**: Create new duplex sinks with custom names and channel configurations
2. **Manage**: View and manage existing sinks, sources, and modules
3. **Output**: View the output of PulseAudio commands

#### Creating a Duplex Sink

1. Go to the "Create" tab
2. Enter a unique name for the sink (no spaces, used as internal identifier)
3. Enter a human-readable description (shown in audio controls)
4. Select the number of channels (1=mono, 2=stereo, etc.)
5. Click "Create Duplex Sink"

#### Managing Modules

1. Go to the "Manage" tab
2. View the list of loaded modules
3. Select a module and click "Unload Selected Module" to remove it

#### Saving Presets

1. Go to the "File" menu
2. Select "Save Preset..."
3. Enter a name for the preset
